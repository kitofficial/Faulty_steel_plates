# Faulty_steel_plates
Classification of Faulty steel plates using different sampling techniques. - Machine learning.
It involves study of improvement in accuracy brought by different sampling techniques and Principal component analysis in Classification of seven different faults in the steel
plate. In this project results are compared by applying Stratified k-fold sampling and kfold sampling techniques with Principal component analysis (PCA) for classification
using Logistic Regression, Support vector machine, and Random forest.
